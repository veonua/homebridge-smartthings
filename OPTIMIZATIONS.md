# Suggested Optimizations

- **Caching**: Maintain a cache of device status information to avoid redundant SmartThings API calls.
- **Error Handling**: Utilize `async`/`await` consistently and handle errors gracefully to prevent unhandled promise rejections.
- **Batch Commands**: Where possible, batch multiple SmartThings commands into a single request to reduce latency.
